Generates my professional resume via code

Previous resume formatted table cells mixed with merges and borders resulting in ATS and various GenAI models parsing my resume incorrectly.

This resume-as-code contains all the standard resume content while adhering to:
- Single line pipe layout for main name, links, contact info
- Aligned tab stops for text line aligning without depending on confusing table-blocking
- Consistent, precise vertical spacing, styling, margins, and indentation
- Format, styling, and arrangement per professional resume writer feedback.

This ensures a theoretically easier reading for a recruiter and hiring manager while optimized for correct ATS parsing reading from top-bottom and left-right.
